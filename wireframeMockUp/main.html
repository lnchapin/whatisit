        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>Regina George is an evil dictator. Now, how do you overthrow a dictator? You cut off her resources. Regina
            would be nothing without her high-status man candy, technically good physique, and ignorant band of loyal
            followers. Now, Caddy, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like
            nothing is wrong. Can you do it? Gretchen Wieners had cracked. Hi. I don't know if anyone told you about me.
            I'm a new student here. My name is Cady Heron. I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle
            school. I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
            Do you guys need anything? Some snacks? A condom? Let me know. Oh, God love you Damian, you've truly
            out-gayed yourself. Here. This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore. Now, where you sit in the
            cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.</p>
